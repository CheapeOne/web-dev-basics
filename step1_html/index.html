    <h1>Basic HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a basic html page. It is static, as there is nothing the user can do to change or update the content. I as the website creator can still periodically update the content here. But a user would have to reload their browser to see any changes.</p>
    <p>I suggest looking at this page in your browser alongside the source code to see what's going on.</p>
    <p>HTML on its own has many capabilities, such as displaying images. The actual image is retrieved from the url in the <strong>src</strong> attribute on the img tag:</p>
    <img src="http://cdn.akc.org/content/article-body-image/samoyed_puppy_dog_pictures.jpg">
    <p>HTML also lets you link to other pages. A link in HTML is called an "anchor", hence the name of the tag below is "a". The thing i'm linking to is in the <strong>href</strong> attribute on the a tag below:</p> 
    <a href="https://google.com">Here's a link to google</a>
    <br/> <!-- The tag to the left is a "line break", which splits my links onto two lines. This is a comment by the way. The browser won't render this so it's only useful for developers. -->
    <a href="http://cdn.akc.org/content/article-body-image/border_collie_dog_pictures_.jpg">Here's a link to an image file.</a>
    <p>There are also lots of HTML tags for various types of inputs, like buttons and text boxes. This won't be too useful for us without some other language to interpret it (cough javascript)</p>
    <button>This is a button that does nothing</button>
    <br/>
    <input type="checkbox">This is a check box</textarea>
    <br/>
    <textarea>This is a text area</textarea>
    <p>As you can see HTMl has some basic tools for displaying and structuring content on a web page. HTML elements have default look ("styling") from the browser you're viewing it in. Each browser does things slightly differently. Instead of using the default styling, we'd rather have a cool custom look to our site. Let's spruce it up in the next step.</p>
